        <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>150g light muscavdo sugar</li>
        <li>125ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>275g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp bicarb</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Tip the coconut oil and sugars into a bowl and whisk until completely combined, then whisk in the coconut milk and vanilla. Tip the flour, baking powder, bicarb and a good pinch of flaky sea salt into the mix to make a thick batter, then fold through the chocolate chips. Chill the batter for at least 1hr. Can be made two days ahead.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a couple of baking sheets with baking parchment, then scoop or roll plum-sized balls of the dough and place them on the baking sheets about 2cm apart. Flatten ever so slightly and sprinkle with a bit more flaky salt if you want. Cook on the middle shelf for 12-15 mins, turning the tray once, until the cookies have spread and are golden but still soft in the middle. Leave to cool slightly, then lift the cookies onto a cooling rack while you bake another batch. Will keep in a biscuit jar for up to three days.</li>
