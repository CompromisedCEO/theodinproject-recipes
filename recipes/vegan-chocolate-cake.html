    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease two 20cm sandwich tins with a little dairy-free sunflower spread, then line the bases with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Put 1 large avocado and 300g light muscovado sugar in a food processor and whizz until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add 350g gluten-free plain flour, 50g cocoa powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 2 tsp gluten-free baking powder, 400ml unsweetened soya milk, 150ml vegetable oil and 2 tsp vanilla extract to the bowl with Â½ tsp fine salt and process again to a velvety, liquid batter.</li>
        <li>Divide between the tins and bake for 25 mins or until fully risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool in the tins for 5 mins, then turn the cakes onto a rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While you wait, start preparing the frosting. Beat together 85g ripe avocado flesh and 85g dairy-free sunflower spread with electric beaters until creamy and smooth. Pass through a sieve and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 200g dairy-free chocolate, either over a bowl of water or in the microwave, then let it cool for a few mins.</li>
        <li>Sift 25g cocoa powder into a large bowl. Bring 125ml unsweetened soya milk to a simmer, then gradually beat into the cocoa until smooth. Cool for a few mins.</li>
        <li>Tip in the avocado mix, 200g sifted icing sugar, melted chocolate and 1 tsp vanilla, and keep mixing to make a shiny, thick frosting. Use this to sandwich and top the cake.</li>
        <li>Cover with sprinkles or your own decoration, then leave to set for 10 mins before slicing. Can be made 2 days ahead.</li>
